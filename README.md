AirBnB Clone Project
This project aims to create an AirBnB clone, a web application that allows users to manage and book accommodations. The project includes the development of a command interpreter, which enables the management of AirBnB objects.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a shell-like interface that allows users to perform various actions on AirBnB objects. These actions include creating new objects, retrieving objects, updating attributes, and deleting objects.

How to Start
To start the command interpreter, run the console.py file. This will open the interactive mode of the command interpreter.
